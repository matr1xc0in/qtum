# A Solidity contract for IPFS Storage Registry

*DO NOT USE truffle-keys.js ADDRESS. THEY ARE INSECURE AND YOU
WILL LOSE YOUR FUND*

We use truffle for development. To setup Truffle,
see https://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/project

* Init npm modiules first for some javascript libs
```
npm install
```

* Compile the contract
```
rm -rf build; truffle compile --reset
```

* Run test on the contract, make sure [ganachi](https://github.com/matr1xc0in/ganache-cli/tree/dockerize-it) is running. We use
local port `7545` here for test. See `./truffle.js`. The key-pairs used for test
case are defined in `./testtruffle-keys.js`.
```
# To kick off Ganachi with predictable key-pairs on local port 7545
# The keys are hardcoded in the script
./run-keys.sh
```
and kick off the test case.
```
truffle test --network=development
```

To run a single test case,
```
# It will still invoke all migration scripts first, but it will only trigger
# one test case for the contract you want to test.
truffle test --network=development test/15_simplegetset.js
```

# Qtum Contract Deployment
* `solar` deployment onto Qtum `testnet` - Deploy your smart contract.
Copy the contract into the container shared volume from your host machine, e.g.
```
cp -rp sc/contracts docker/testnet/qtum_data/
```
and now, if you are already running the `./docker/run-shell.sh` console, and you follow
from the parent's `README.md` file, you can access and deploy your contracts from the
wallet created before `qVuqcjpBmRYGjjVZm1q1LFa28KJGQYPepC` (assumed you have funded from
[Testnet faucet](http://testnet-faucet.qtum.info/#!/)) directly by running:
```
cd /dapp
solar --qtum_rpc=$QTUM_RPC --qtum_sender=qVuqcjpBmRYGjjVZm1q1LFa28KJGQYPepC --optimize deploy --force contracts/SimpleGetSet.sol
```
e.g.
```
exec: solc [contracts/SimpleGetSet.sol --combined-json bin,metadata --optimize --allow-paths /dapp]
ðŸš€  All contracts confirmed
   deployed contracts/SimpleGetSet.sol => 43b39311a957ced773bd5373d9c58338c53c48f5
/dapp $ qcli fromhexaddress 43b39311a957ced773bd5373d9c58338c53c48f5
qPjMYwN7QnjC1mdJYfSJKrZiqXfRC4Ne61
```
and you can look them up on https://testnet.qtum.org e.g.
contract address - https://testnet.qtum.org/address/qPjMYwN7QnjC1mdJYfSJKrZiqXfRC4Ne61
qtum address balance - https://testnet.qtum.org/address/qVuqcjpBmRYGjjVZm1q1LFa28KJGQYPepC

# Inspecting Contract and Functions
If you have the docker container for `qcli` up and running (or see the `docker/README.md` in 
this repository), you should be able to have a prompt.

e.g. launching a `qcli` container that connects to `testnet`.
```
QTUM_NETWORK=testnet ./run-shell.sh
```
Now, you can run the command and argument to convert Qtum wallet address to Hexidecimal format.
```
/dapp $ qcli gethexaddress qVuqcjpBmRYGjjVZm1q1LFa28KJGQYPepC
877feaaf2658f2faa90dc14528674c7e8331b980
/dapp $ qcli gethexaddress qR7LMJGTNTktrhd5AUeyNkGQNAnPzdX5eu
52d3d96201bc1edf7f47d14b0ef4fd4210a4dba0
```

You can use these hexidecimal wallet address to interact with your contract via the
ABI player Web UI if you are running the `./docker/run-testnet.sh`.

http://localhost:9899/abiplay/

You can import the contract's ABI JSON file which can be found in `./webserver/solar.development.json`.
**BE AWARE, If you update the contract and re-deployed, make sure you keep a copy of the ABI JSON file**
here so others can pick it up and use it.

# Known Issues
* https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/issues/548 Proxy contract cannot invoke a remote contract function.
Workaround is to combine all contracts into 1 contract and deploy it. Yeah, gas killer and may be costly, etc.
